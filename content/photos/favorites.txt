favorite photos (for the wall maybe?)

1. me and danny at graduation - we look so young and dumb. love it.
2. the sunset at cedar pond - genuinely incredible. not even filtered.
3. grandma's lily pad garden - taken the summer before she passed. precious.
4. the group shot from new years 2022 - everyone's there. simpler times.
5. that one of me mid-jump - marcus took it. i look like i'm flying.
6. mom and dad's anniversary party - they look so happy.

there's one of me and alex at the marsh that would be on this list but. it's complicated. it was a really good photo.
