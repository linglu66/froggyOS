the trip - day 2

woke up early and went swimming before breakfast. the water was cold but perfect. alex made pancakes, slightly burnt but good anyway.

hiked to the waterfall. took a million photos. alex kept making me pose which i pretended to hate but didn't.

afternoon nap. read books on the dock. did nothing and it was everything.

dinner at that little place in town. the waiter thought we were on our honeymoon for some reason. we didn't correct him.

watched the stars from the dock. counted three shooting stars. made wishes. won't say what.
