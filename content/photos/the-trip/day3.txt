the trip - day 3

last day. neither of us wanted to pack. kept finding excuses to stay a little longer.

one more swim. one more coffee on the porch. one more walk around the lake.

alex said "we should do this every year." i said "definitely."

we didn't, obviously.

the drive back was quieter. sunday scaries setting in. back to real life.

i didn't know it then but that was maybe the happiest i've ever been. funny how you never know it while it's happening.
