notes for next time

- bring more snacks
- the blue cooler leaks, use the green one
- that restaurant closes early on sundays
- mosquito spray (forgot and regretted it)
- download movies in case wifi sucks

there won't be a next time. not with alex anyway. but i couldn't bring myself to delete this file.

maybe i'll go back alone someday. or with someone else. or maybe some places should stay frozen in time.
