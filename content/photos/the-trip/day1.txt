the trip - day 1

drove up to the lake house. took forever because of traffic. alex wanted to stop every hour which was annoying at the time but probably the right call.

got there around sunset. the lake was perfect, all golden and still. we just stood there for a while not saying anything.

had sandwiches for dinner because we were too tired to cook. fell asleep on the couch watching something. woke up at 2am and moved to the bed.

good day. one of the good ones.
