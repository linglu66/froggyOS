photos to organize (someday)

- all the random screenshots on my phone
- that folder of memes i saved
- vacation pics from two years ago (still not sorted)
- danny's birthday party pics
- the ones from marcus's wedding (maybe move to a separate folder)
- food photos i took for some reason
- accidental selfies
- pictures of my apartment when i first moved in (for the security deposit thing)
- screenshots of recipes i'll never make
- too many pictures of sunsets. i get it, the sky is pretty

there's also like 200 photos from when alex and i were together. they're in a folder called "camera roll backup 2023" which is a lie. i'm not ready to deal with those.
