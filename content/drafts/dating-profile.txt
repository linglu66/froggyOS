about me:

frog, late 20s. recently single (is a year still recent?). trying to figure out what i want.

i like: quiet mornings at the pond, cooking (badly), music, long swims, bad movies, good books, my friends

i'm looking for: something real? someone patient. not sure i'm ready but maybe that's how it works - you're never ready until you try.

i should warn you: i'm still a little broken. working on it. in therapy. learning to be okay on my own first.

haven't posted this anywhere. just wanted to see what it would feel like to write it. maybe soon.
