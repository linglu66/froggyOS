about me:

frog. recently single (is a season still recent?). trying to figure out what i want.

i like: quiet mornings on the lily pad, catching flies (badly), croaking at the moon, long swims, watching the dragonflies, good spots in the sun, my friends

i'm looking for: something real? someone patient. not sure i'm ready but maybe that's how it works - you're never ready until you try.

i should warn you: i'm still a little broken. working on it. seeing the pond counselor. learning to be okay on my own first.

haven't posted this anywhere. just wanted to see what it would feel like to write it. maybe soon.
