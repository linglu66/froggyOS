guitar progress

chords i know:
- G (mostly)
- C (fingers won't cooperate)
- D (easy)
- Em (this one's fine)
- Am (fine)

songs to learn:
- wonderwall (basic but gotta start somewhere)
- horse with no name (two chords!)
- good riddance - green day
- wish you were here - pink floyd (someday)

haven't picked it up in two months. the guitar just sits there looking at me. alex always said i should learn. so i bought one. and then.

maybe tomorrow.
