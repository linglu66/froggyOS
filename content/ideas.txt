ideas (maybe)

1. rearrange the lily pads so the big one is closer to the morning sun spot. sick of hopping so far when im still half asleep

2. actually learn to catch dragonflies instead of just watching them go by like an idiot. youtube tutorial?

3. start a blog about the bog. "bog blog" or "frog log"? both bad. think about it more

4. ask the heron if he wants to be friends or if hes actually trying to eat me. feels important to know

5. fermented fly thing?? saw someone mention it on a forum. could be disgusting could be life changing
