therapy homework - week of jan 20

1. write down three things you did well this week
   - showed up to work every day (low bar but still)
   - cooked one actual meal
   - didn't text alex when i wanted to (hardest one)

2. identify one negative thought pattern and challenge it
   - thought: "i'm going to be alone forever"
   - challenge: "you've been single for less than a year, that's not forever, you're being dramatic"
   - did it work: kind of

3. do one thing that scares you
   - went to a coffee shop alone and sat there for an hour
   - it was fine. nothing happened. that's the point i think.

4. practice self-compassion
   - i don't know what this means honestly. i said "good job buddy" to myself in the mirror and felt insane.
