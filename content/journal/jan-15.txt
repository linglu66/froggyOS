jan 15

bad day. saw alex at the grocery store. we did the awkward nod thing. they looked good. i looked like i just woke up because i did.

came home and sat in the dark for a while. not in a dramatic way just. didn't feel like turning the lights on.

danny called and i let it go to voicemail. i should call him back. i will. tomorrow.

ate cereal for dinner. the healthy kind so it's fine.

therapist says i'm making progress. doesn't feel like it but i guess she'd know.

going to bed early. tired of today.
