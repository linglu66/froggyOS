bad day. saw alex at the lily pad market. we did the awkward croak thing. they looked good. i looked like i just crawled out of the mud because i did.

came home and sat on my rock for a while. not in a dramatic way just. didn't feel like swimming around.

danny croaked at me from across the pond and i pretended not to hear. i should swim over. i will. tomorrow.

ate some mosquito larvae for dinner. the fresh kind so it's fine.

therapist says i'm making progress. doesn't feel like it but i guess she'd know.

going to sleep early. tired of today.
