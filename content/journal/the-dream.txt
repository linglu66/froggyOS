the dream i keep having

we're at the pond but it's bigger, like an ocean. alex is there but far away, on the other side. i try to swim to them but the water is thick, like honey, and i can't move fast enough. every time i get close they drift further.

then the sun goes down really fast and i'm alone in the dark water and i wake up.

had it three times this month. therapist says it's about letting go. probably.

i just want one night of normal sleep.
