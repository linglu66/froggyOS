mar 3

actually okay day? went to the far end of the pond with danny and marcus. floated around, talked about nothing. marcus is having tadpoles which is insane. we're old enough for that now apparently.

didn't think about alex until just now writing this. that's something.

tried the new lily pad spot for hunting. the flies were mid but the view was nice. might go back.

signed up for a bubble-blowing class. starts next week. never done it before but it seems like the kind of thing a frog who has their life together would do. fake it til you make it or whatever.

feeling almost hopeful tonight. writing that down so i remember it's possible.
