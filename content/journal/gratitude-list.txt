things i'm grateful for (therapist's idea)

1. danny (always picks up when i call, never makes it weird)
2. the pond on quiet mornings
3. my health i guess
4. having a job even if it's boring
5. my apartment (even though it's haunted by memories)
6. that one barista who remembers my order
7. music
8. the fact that seasons change and nothing stays the same forever, even the bad stuff

okay this is getting too real. stopping now.
