pet names (if i ever get one)

for a fish (ironic?):
- gilbert
- swimothy
- blub
- poseidon (too dramatic?)

for a snail:
- gary (classic)
- shelly
- turbo
- escargot (fancy)

for a small mammal (if the landlord allows):
- mochi
- bean
- potato
- sir reginald von fluffington (nickname: reggie)

danny says i should get a pet. says it would be good for me. maybe he's right. something to take care of. something that needs me.
