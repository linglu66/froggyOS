- "you have a really calming presence" - stranger at a party
- "you're stronger than you think" - therapist
- "you always know the right thing to say" - danny (lying but sweet)
- "i love your laugh" - alex, a long time ago
- "you're a good person going through a hard time" - mom
- "your skin looks great, what's your routine" - coworker (it's just water and genetics)
- "you seem different lately. like lighter somehow" - marcus, last week
