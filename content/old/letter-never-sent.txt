alex,

i've started this letter like fifteen times. i don't know what i want to say. maybe that's the problem, i never knew how to croak things until it was too late.

i'm sorry for the times i went quiet instead of talking. i'm sorry i made you guess what i was feeling. i'm sorry i didn't swim harder when things got hard. i'm sorry for that thing i said on the lily pad that night, you know the one.

but also - and i don't know if i'm allowed to say this - i'm sorry you gave up too. it wasn't just me. we both let it drift away.

i miss you. not the end of us, but the beginning. the middle. the parts where it was easy and good and i thought it would be forever.

i don't know if i'll ever send this. probably not. some things are just for me to know.

i hope you're okay. i hope you're happy. i hope you think of me sometimes and it doesn't hurt anymore.

- frog
