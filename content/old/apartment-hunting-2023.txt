apartment hunting with alex - spring 2023

must haves:
- two sinks (alex takes forever in the bathroom)
- natural light
- space for both our stuff
- close to both our jobs (compromise)
- room for guests

places we looked at:
- maple grove unit 7 (too small)
- the lily pad on 5th (too expensive but we loved it)
- cedar creek place (weird landlord)
- riverside apartments (we almost took this one)
- brookside commons (winner!)

we were so excited. picked out furniture. talked about paint colors. made a whole shared pinterest board.

moved in august 2023. moved out (just me) november 2024.

fifteen months. felt longer. felt shorter. felt like everything.
