one year anniversary ideas

- recreate our first date (the bad sushi place that closed)
- go back to the lake house
- concert? alex mentioned wanting to see that band
- fancy dinner at the marsh house (need reservations way ahead)
- matching something? cheesy but cute
- write a letter about the year
- photo album of our best moments

budget: like $200? can stretch to 300 if it's really good

we never made it to one year. two months short. i found this file the other day and it felt like finding a fossil from another life.
