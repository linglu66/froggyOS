voicemail from alex - saved nov 18

"hey, it's me. i know we said we wouldn't do this but i was walking by the pond today, the one by the coffee place, and i just... i don't know. i thought about calling you like twenty times this week. i hope you're doing okay. i hope... anyway. you don't have to call back. i just wanted you to know i was thinking about you. okay. bye."

i listened to this maybe fifty times in the first week. then i made myself stop. haven't listened in a month now.

should probably delete it eventually. but not yet.
