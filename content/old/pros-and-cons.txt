pros and cons of staying

pros:
- love alex (still, despite everything)
- built a life together
- scared of starting over
- what if this is as good as it gets
- comfortable
- know each other's everything
- don't want to be alone

cons:
- feel alone anyway
- we don't talk anymore, not really
- can't remember the last time we laughed together
- walking on eggshells
- growing apart or maybe just finally seeing clearly
- deserve to be happy not just comfortable
- this isn't what love is supposed to feel like

made this list in october. left in november. looking at it now the answer seems obvious. it wasn't obvious at the time.
