groceries

- flies (regular)
- flies (the crunchy kind from near the reeds)
- that good algae from the place on the east bank, not the weird algae from last time
- crickets for the weekend maybe? see how i feel
- mosquito larvae if they have any left
- more flies actually get extra
- something nice? idk
