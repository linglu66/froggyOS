apartment hunting notes

requirements:
- near water (obviously)
- not too much direct sun
- quiet neighbors, no herons in the building
- laundry in unit would be nice
- enough space for my stuff and like, a guest? eventually?

places to check:
- that spot by the marsh (expensive but nice)
- danny's building has openings
- the place on Cedar Pond Rd (sketchy area?)

budget: can afford up to 1200/month if i stop getting delivery so much

moving is terrifying but i cant keep living in the place we picked out together. everything here is a reminder.
