lily pad hunting notes

requirements:
- good water depth (obviously)
- not too much direct sun
- quiet neighbors, no herons in the area
- private mud bank would be nice
- enough space for my stuff and like, a guest? eventually?

places to check:
- that spot by the marsh (expensive but nice)
- danny's pond has openings
- the place on Cedar Pond (sketchy herons nearby?)

budget: can afford up to 1200 flies/month if i stop eating out so much

moving is terrifying but i cant keep living on the pad we picked out together. everything here is a reminder.
