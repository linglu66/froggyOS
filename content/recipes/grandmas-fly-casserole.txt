grandma's fly casserole

she never wrote this down so im doing it from memory

- 2 cups assorted flies (she used the ones from near the old mill but those are hard to find now)
- 1 cup algae (dried, not fresh)
- a handful of that moss she always had in the jar
- water from the good part of the pond
- "a little bit of love" (not helpful grandma)

1. soak the flies overnight
2. mix with algae and moss in the big dish
3. let it sit in the sun for a few hours
4. something about folding it? i forget this part
5. serve cold

i've tried to make this three times and it never tastes like hers. maybe i'm forgetting something.

miss you grandma.
