recipes to try someday

- that fermented fly thing from the internet
- danny's mosquito larvae soup (need to get recipe)
- something with worms? could be good
- homemade algae chips
- whatever that thing was at the restaurant last month

i should cook more. i keep ordering delivery and its expensive and sad.
