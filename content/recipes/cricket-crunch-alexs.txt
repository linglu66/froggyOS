alex's cricket crunch thing

they made this for my birthday once. i watched and tried to remember.

ingredients:
- crickets (the good ones, legs removed)
- some kind of sauce (soy sauce maybe? or that stuff from the asian market)
- sesame seeds
- green onion
- alex knew how much of everything. i never measured.

it was so good. i asked for the recipe and alex said "i'll make it whenever you want" instead of telling me.

i could probably figure it out but it wouldn't be the same.
