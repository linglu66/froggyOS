performance review prep

things i did well (supposedly):
- caught my quota of flies mostly
- "good pond citizen" whatever that means
- handled the heron situation in september

things to "work on":
- being more proactive (i hate this word)
- croaking up in meetings
- "lily pad presence" ???

what i wanted to say but didn't:
- i catch twice the bugs gerald does
- the quotas are unrealistic and everyone knows it
- im tired
