performance review prep

things i did well (supposedly):
- met deadlines mostly
- "good team player" whatever that means
- handled the client situation in september

things to "work on":
- being more proactive (i hate this word)
- speaking up in meetings
- "executive presence" ???

what i wanted to say but didn't:
- i do twice the work gerald does
- the deadlines are unrealistic and everyone knows it
- im tired
