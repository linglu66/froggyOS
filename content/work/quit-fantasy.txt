Dear Patricia,

I am writing to inform you that I will be resigning from my position effective immediately.

I have decided to pursue my dream of [what IS my dream actually]

Thank you for the opportunity but honestly this job is slowly killing me and I think about leaving every single day.

Best regards,
Frog
