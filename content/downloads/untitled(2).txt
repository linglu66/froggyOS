things i want in a partner (therapist said to write this down)

- actually listens
- has their own thing going on
- makes me laugh
- kind to strangers
- likes the quiet
- won't make me feel crazy for feeling things
- wants to grow

i don't know. this feels stupid. what i really want is to not feel so alone all the time but you can't put that on a list.
